#### Dan's Notes:

I appreciate this project and feel better about my JavaScript abilities for having completed it.  I know I submitted late, also, but reiterate that Sunday has afforded me the time to get more of my projects done.  I will continue to update my projects because I learn more when I continue working on them, and realize that I can learn from writing different code to get the same application.
